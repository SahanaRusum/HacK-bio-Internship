KEGG:

KEGG Database and Its Application in Cancer Research

The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) is a valuable bioinformatics database which combines data on genes, chemicals, and biological functions to notice how molecules interact in processes such as signaling and metabolism. KEGG is an important tool for cancer research, offering resources that help researchers analyze the pathways involved in cancer. These pathways reveal how cancer develops and spreads. KEGG database provides a clear layout for cancer-related pathways, such as PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and p53, which allow researchers to connect any genetic mutations and changes in gene activity to a larger cellular function, thereby giving them a more complete understanding of cancer as a whole (Kanehisa et al., 2017).

One of the applications of the KEGG database in cancer research is pathway enrichment analysis, which is to identify abnormal signaling and metabolic pathways that are involved in tumors. For example, in a study conducted on colorectal cancer, researchers used the KEGG database to explore the critical pathways and molecular interactions that are responsible for tumor growth. They specifically examined the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for cell growth and differentiation. By comparing the gene expression data collected from colorectal cancer samples with KEGGâ€™s pathway information, they discovered significant disruptions in the Wnt signaling pathway and also in other processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and more. These findings helped the researchers to understand how the tumor grows, and it provided possible targets for the treatment. This example shows how the KEGG database can turn complicated genetic data into useful information for developing cancer treatments, thereby proving an important role in cancer research and therapy (Z. Feng et al., 2020).

In conclusion, the KEGG database is an invaluable tool for cancer research, enabling researchers to understand cancer even at the molecular level. By showing how changes in genes affect different biological pathways, the KEGG database makes it easier to find new potential targets for treatment, thereby making it a vital tool in the development of precision medicine approaches to cancer treatment.
